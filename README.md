### What I learned

I revised by HTML and CSS skills by completing challenge.


### My workflow and planning

- I designed HTML template first by planning the wrpappers, containers based on layout.
- I used __ to give children class names so that I don't have to struggle with specificity.
- The CSS code flow:
  - Downloaded the fonts and imported using @font-face.
  - Defined custom properties such as color (--clr-shade-num) and font-size (--fs-num) in :root.
  - Defined custom properties such as color (--clr-shade-num) and font-size (--fs-num) in :root.
  - Reset some CSS styles from the pre-existing default styles.
  - Set the typography (font-size, font-weight, color, font-face etc.)
  - Started shaping the layout.
